Here there are the commands I use to compile and run the project.

COMPILE:
	From inside the build folder run "cmake .." and, after that, "make"
	NOTE: if there is no build folder in the project main folder you must create it "mkdir build && cd build"
	
RUN:
	Command guide is shown when there is something wrong with the input arguments.
